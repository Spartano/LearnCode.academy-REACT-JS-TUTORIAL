## Installation

Download the repository to your computer and follow the usage guide below.

## Usage

Get a react environment set up quickly with this boilerplate.

It includes all the modules you need. All you need to do is download the project, unzip it, run node and start building.
First install everything then run the webpack dev server

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will get your app running on http://localhost:8080

Webpack will watch for changes and update the browser when a file is changed.

Use src/js/client.js to import your modules into. This compiles to src/client.min.js, and is loaded into index.html.
